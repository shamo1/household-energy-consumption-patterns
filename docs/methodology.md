## Feature Engineering

### Temporal Features

```python
# Time-based Features
df['hour'] = df['timestamp'].dt.hour
df['day_of_week'] = df['timestamp'].dt.dayofweek
df['month'] = df['timestamp'].dt.month
df['quarter'] = df['timestamp'].dt.quarter
df['is_weekend'] = df['day_of_week'].isin([5, 6])
df['is_holiday'] = df['timestamp'].dt.date.isin(holidays)
```

### Statistical Features

```python
# Rolling Statistics
df['consumption_24h_mean'] = df['total_consumption'].rolling(96).mean()
df['consumption_7d_mean'] = df['total_consumption'].rolling(672).mean()
df['consumption_24h_std'] = df['total_consumption'].rolling(96).std()

# Lag Features
for lag in [1, 4, 24, 96]:  # 15min, 1h, 6h, 24h
    df[f'consumption_lag_{lag}'] = df['total_consumption'].shift(lag)
```

### Domain-Specific Features

```python
# Energy Balance
df['net_consumption'] = df['import'] - df['export']
df['self_consumption_rate'] = df['pv'] / df['total_consumption']
df['grid_dependency'] = df['import'] / df['total_consumption']
